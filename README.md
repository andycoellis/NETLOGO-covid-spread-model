#### Summary
> This NetLogo model attempts to create insight into the behaviour space of a Covid-19 pandemic. The model constructs a dense population with places of work and small businesses, on this basis the model aims to navigate a responsive economy that lays between a pandemic and population. The model shows a responsive and configurable environment. The design implements a policy intervention system that helps maintain a low disease reproductive rate; however, as explored this is not beneficial to the modelâ€™s economy.

This project is built off the backbone/code of the *Spread of Disease* model found from the online [IABM Textbook/chapter 6](https://netlogoweb.org/launch#https://netlogoweb.org/assets/modelslib/IABM%20Textbook/chapter%206/Spread%20of%20Disease.nlogo)
